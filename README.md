# micropython_pushbullet
Simple example of how to use pushbullet with MicroPython on ESP8266. I use a simple circuit with a pushbutton to send push notification to smartphone.

## How to use

You need to create an account on pushbullet.com, then get the Access Token from Setting-Account-Create Access Token.

In wlan.py replace with the name of your SSID and password; in push.py replace apiKey with your own.
